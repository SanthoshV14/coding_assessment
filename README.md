# README for Weather App CLI App and Median Finding Script

## 1. Weather App CLI
This Python-based command-line interface (CLI) application allows users to fetch real-time weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It also provides functionality to manage a list of favorite cities.

### Features

- **Weather Lookup**: Get current weather details (temperature, humidity, pressure, sunrise, sunset, etc.) for any city.
- **Favorites Management**:
  - Add a city to the favorites list (max 3 cities).
  - Remove a city from the favorites list.
  - Display the list of favorite cities.
- **User-Friendly Instructions**: Clear guidance provided within the application.

### Security Note

The OpenWeatherMap API key is encrypted using Base64 encoding for basic security. However, in production environments we have to store API keys securely using environment variables or secret management tools.

# 2. Median Finder

This Python program calculates the median of a list of numbers provided by the user or randomly generated by the program. It uses the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the numbers before computing the median.

## Features

- **User Input**: Accepts a list of comma-separated numbers from the user.
- **Random Number Generation**: Generates random numbers for testing if no input is provided.
- **Median Calculation**: Handles both odd and even-length lists accurately.
- **Bubble Sort Implementation**: Uses the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the numbers.

### Usage
```text
1. Enter the numbers as comma separated values
        or
2. Just press enter to generate random numbers:
```
- **Option 1**: Provide a list of numbers as comma-separated values.  
  Example Input:
  ```text
  1, 5, 3, 7, 9
  ```
  Output:
  ```text
  Input is: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
  median is: 5
  ```

- **Option 2**: Press Enter to let the program generate random numbers. It calculates and displays the median for both odd-sized and even-sized lists.  
  Example Output:
  ```text
  ODD size 11 input: [43, 22, 10, 54, 36, 78, 91, 85, 67, 32, 40]
  median is: 43

  EVEN size 10 input: [12, 39, 58, 27, 91, 33, 44, 56, 29, 68]
  median is: 41.5
  ```
